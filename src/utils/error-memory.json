      "context": "This error occurs when a variable is declared (e.g., using const, let, or var, or as a useState setter) but never used or assigned a new value within its scope.",
      "solution": "Remove the unused variable declaration. If it's a useState setter that's unused, remove it from the destructuring assignment: e.g. `const [myState, setMyState] = useState(initialValue)` becomes `const [myState] = useState(initialValue)` if `setMyState` is not used.",
